    "question": "What are the main risks at this location?",
    "generative_answer": "The main risks at this location include fire, flood, earthquake, and climate-related hazards. Fire risks are considered to be low due to the lack of directly adjacent structures, however, there is still a risk of fire due to human error or other causes. Flood risks are low due to the facility being located outside the 500-year flood zone, but it is still important to monitor the area for potential flooding. Earthquake risks are moderate due to the facility being located in the MR earthquake zone. Climate-related hazards such as snow, ice, and wind can also pose a risk to the facility.",

Programs reviewed included\n    the following:\n    - Housekeeping;\n    - Hot Work;\n    - Fire Protection Impairments;\n    - Fire Protection Inspection and Maintenance;\n    - Management of Change;\n    - Smoking Policy;\n    - Contractors Work Procedures;\n    - Emergency Procedures;\n    - Business Contingency Planning;\n    Continuity of combustibles throughout the site is generally considered light to moderate in most areas.\n    Production hazards are considered to be low and are generally well controlled.\n    Security at this site is considered to be adequate with access control systems in place in all building.\n    Security service is provided on site during the day shift. All fire alarms ring to the security headquarters\n    at the Some Aerospace Facility in Broomfield, Colorado.\n    Key opportunities for improvement were observed with recommendations made as follows:\n    1. Improve or add sprinkler protection in critical areas;\n    2. Improve maintenance and inspection of fire protection equipment;\n    3. Improve inspection and service of fire extinguishers;\n    4. Provide battery backup for aspirating smoke detection systems in in critical assembly and testing areas;\n    5. Improving storage of flammable liquids on the FA dock;\n    6. Repair the leaking fire department connection for the FA building;\n    7. Provide CO2 fire protection for the Heller 1707 MK III wave soldering machine in the FA building;\n    8. Develop an effective business contingency plan for all critical operations;\n    9. The solid shelving in the store room area should to allow for fire sprinkler distribution;\n    Overall the Somwhere facility was found to be well maintained with excellent.
