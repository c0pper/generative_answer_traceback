    """Occupancy/Special Hazards
This site manufactures satellites, satellite components as well as sensors and antenna systems for
satellites. Primary customers are the U.S. Government include the Department of Defense and NASA, as
well as private industry who work with space and earth sciences. Supporting activities include R&D,
design, and testing. The facility includes many labs for specific disciplines as well as two machine shops.
Production is currently supported by a staff of approximately 2,466 employees working mostly a single
shift. The Some Springfield campus covers nearly 835,000 in over 20 owned and leased buildings of non-
combustible construction. Approximately 70% of the buildings are sprinklered. The main production /
assembly areas are in the FA, YY, FI and FT building complex on Commerce street. These buildings
include various labs, testing assemblies, clean rooms and component assembly areas. Overhead cranes
are provided in the high bay areas and some clean rooms to handle larger project components.
The remaining buildings on the Springfield Some campus are for various labs, offices, engineering,
technical service, facilities, design and R&D. It is understood these functions while important are not
critical to the ongoing work in the ”F” building complexes as the work could be performed elsewhere.
Hazards include the storage and handling of flammable liquids and waste solvents in lab areas. Approved
flammable liquids cabinets are in place and procedure seem adequate except for the temporary storage
of flammables on the building FA dock while waiting QC testing and inspection. Flammable flux is used in
the FA building wave soldiering machine that has a flash point of 52 deg F. CO 2 protection has been
recommended.
A detached approved flammable liquids storage container is located detached approximately 18 ft
from the north wall of building YY for the storage of waste solvent and miscellaneous flammables. The
building is protected with an automatic dry chemical system""",

"""Utilities
Electrical Systems – The power to the plant is supplied by a single feeds to the various facility buildings.
The electrical power supply is reported to be reliable.
Annual infrared thermal scans are made annually.
Transformers – The main transformers are owned and maintained by the electrical utility. There are
several oil filled medium voltage transformers are located on site. Transformer oil testing is completed on
an annual basis with the last testing in March of 2001. There are no PCBs reported in any transformers.
Overhead Lighting – No unusual features.
Natural Gas/Building Heat – Buildings are heated by natural gas fired unit heaters or furnaces.
Industrial Boilers – There are several Patterson Kelly small gas-fired boiler throughout with acceptable
combustion controls.
Chilled Water – There are Chillers in Buildings FT and FA to serve the “F” building complex. The
cooling tower located between Building FT and YY is reported to contain YY approved fill material.
Compressed Air Systems – Air compressors are provided with a level of redundant capacity. The units
are rotated in and out of service to even the life cycle. Compressed air can be provided via trailer
mounted units if needed.
Emergency Diesel Generators – Emergency are installed in the “F” Complex for computers, phones and
emergency lighting;
Lift Trucks – none
Vacuum Pumps – Very small units in some labs, with larger units for the 2 large vacuum chambers;""",

"""Business Interruption Features
This plant is currently operating at what appears to be 100% capacity with very little available production
in the event of a loss resulting in an interruption of operations.
Contingency plans call for assistance from other Some location in Broomfield, Colorado. However
many functions not available in Broomfield that include Lubrication Lab, Polymerics Lab, Cleaning Lab,
X-ray, NDT, dimensional tolerances, Metal Finish shop, Detector Technology Center, Metrology,
components in the Machine shop, Electronics Production Lab, Weld shop, acoustical testing, Vibration
Lab, Vacuum Lac, Leak Check Lab, EMI shops, and many of the cleanrooms. In addition the large
vacuum chamber used for testing is not duplicated and could take up top 18 months to replace.
The use of outside vendors for parts varies from 30 to 70% approximately based on the project
and customer requirements. Most but not all parts have at least two approved suppliers.
Some can manufacture some parts or purchase if needed provided the supplier is customer approved.
Computer data is backed up either daily or weekly (depending on the data) to the Some facility
in Westminster, CO.
It should be noted that full observation of all areas and photographs were not permitted due to security
requirements. Additionally critical information to develop accurate Business Interruption loss estimates
was also denied for the same security requirements. All comments and recommendations is based only
on the areas observed and information provided.""",

"""Intrusion Supervision – None
Watchman – Security at this site is considered to be adequate with access control systems in place in all
building. Security service is provided on site during the day shift. All fire alarms ring to the security
headquarters at the Some Aerospace Facility in Otherplace, Colorado.
Operating Hours – The plant operates one shift 5 – 6 days based on department and projects / testing in
progress."""
