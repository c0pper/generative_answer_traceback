The current occupancies will be shifted to other buildings on the campus\nduring the project. When completed many of the occupants of the leased buildings will be moved to the new\nengineering building.\nAdditionally, plans are also being made to install sprinklers in several of the buildings owned by Some in\naccordance with YY Global previous recommendations including the penthouse supporting the FA clean\nroom and the 3rd floor north area of building FT. Design specifics and schedules were not available.\nThe site has recently completed a new electrical connection and switch gear for Building FI. The new\nequipment will increase reliability and capacity for additional equipment with in the complex.\nThe FA large clean room is expected to be changed to an assembly area in the next 2 years.\nYY Global recommendations 13-03-002 & 003 have been reported completed.\nNo sprinklers have been recommended for the T-1,2,3 and Tech Tower or leased building based on limited\nimpact to operations and impeding replacement by the new engineering building.",

Programs reviewed included\nthe following:\n- Housekeeping;\n- Hot Work;\n- Fire Protection Impairments;\n- Fire Protection Inspection and Maintenance;\n- Management of Change;\n- Smoking Policy;\n- Contractors Work Procedures;\n- Emergency Procedures;\n- Business Contingency Planning;\nContinuity of combustibles throughout the site is generally considered light to moderate in most areas.\nProduction hazards are considered to be low and are generally well controlled.\nSecurity at this site is considered to be adequate with access control systems in place in all building.\nSecurity service is provided on site during the day shift. All fire alarms ring to the security headquarters\nat the Some Aerospace Facility in Broomfield, Colorado.\nKey opportunities for improvement were observed with recommendations made as follows:\n1. Improve or add sprinkler protection in critical areas;\n2. Improve maintenance and inspection of fire protection equipment;\n3. Improve inspection and service of fire extinguishers;\n4. Provide battery backup for aspirating smoke detection systems in in critical assembly and testing areas;\n5. Improving storage of flammable liquids on the FA dock;\n6. Repair the leaking fire department connection for the FA building;\n7. Provide CO2 fire protection for the Heller 1707 MK III wave soldering machine in the FA building;\n8. Develop an effective business contingency plan for all critical operations;\n9. The solid shelving in the store room area should to allow for fire sprinkler distribution;\nOverall the Somwhere facility was found to be well maintained with excellent. Cooperation of the plant\nfacilities staff was very much appreciated.",
