 Occupancy/Special Hazards
    This site manufactures satellites, satellite components as well as sensors and antenna systems for
    satellites. Primary customers are the U.S. Government include the Department of Defense and NASA, as
    well as private industry who work with space and earth sciences. Supporting activities include R&D,
    design, and testing. The facility includes many labs for specific disciplines as well as two machine shops.
    Production is currently supported by a staff of approximately 2,466 employees working mostly a single
    shift. The Some Springfield campus covers nearly 835,000 in over 20 owned and leased buildings of non-
    combustible construction. Approximately 70% of the buildings are sprinklered. The main production /
    assembly areas are in the FA, YY, FI and FT building complex on Commerce street. These buildings
    include various labs, testing assemblies, clean rooms and component assembly areas. Overhead cranes
    are provided in the high bay areas and some clean rooms to handle larger project components.
    The remaining buildings on the Springfield Some campus are for various labs, offices, engineering,
    technical service, facilities, design and R&D. It is understood these functions while important are not
    critical to the ongoing work in the ”F” building complexes as the work could be performed elsewhere.
    Hazards include the storage and handling of flammable liquids and waste solvents in lab areas. Approved
    flammable liquids cabinets are in place and procedure seem adequate except for the temporary storage
    of flammables on the building FA dock while waiting QC testing and inspection. Flammable flux is used in
    the FA building wave soldiering machine that has a flash point of 52 deg F. CO 2 protection has been
    recommended.
    A detached approved flammable liquids storage container is located detached approximately 18 ft
    from the north wall of building YY for the storage of waste solvent and miscellaneous flammables. The
    building is protected with an automatic dry chemical system

2023-10-23 10:37:53,204 - INFO - +++++++Generated_answer: The main risks at this location include fire, flood, earthquake, and climate-related hazards. Fire risks are considered to be low due to the lack of directly adjacent structures, however, there is still a risk of fire due to human error or other causes. Flood risks are low due to the facility being located outside the 500-year flood zone, but it is still important to monitor the area for potential flooding. Earthquake risks are moderate due to the facility being located in the MR earthquake zone. Climate-related hazards such as snow, ice, and wind can also pose a risk to the facility.

    This site manufactures satellites, satellite components as well as sensors and antenna systems for
    satellites. Primary customers are the U.S. Government include the Department of Defense and NASA, as
    well as private industry who work with space and earth sciences. Supporting activities include R&D,
    design, and testing. The facility includes many labs for specific disciplines as well as two machine shops.
    Production is currently supported by a staff of approximately 2,466 employees working mostly a single
    shift. The Some Springfield campus covers nearly 835,000 in over 20 owned and leased buildings of non-
    combustible construction. Approximately 70% of the buildings are sprinklered. The main production /
    assembly areas are in the FA, YY, FI and FT building complex on Commerce street. These buildings
    include various labs, testing assemblies, clean rooms and component assembly areas. Overhead cranes
    are provided in the high bay areas and some clean rooms to handle larger project components.
    The remaining buildings on the Springfield Some campus are for various labs, offices, engineering,
    technical service, facilities, design and R&D. It is understood these functions while important are not
    critical to the ongoing work in the ”F” building complexes as the work could be performed elsewhere.
    Hazards include the storage and handling of flammable liquids and waste solvents in lab areas. Approved
    flammable liquids cabinets are in place and procedure seem adequate except for the temporary storage
    of flammables on the building FA dock while waiting QC testing and inspection. Flammable flux is used in
    the FA building wave soldiering machine that has a flash point of 52 deg F. CO 2 protection has been
    recommended.
    A detached approved flammable liquids storage container is located detached approximately 18 ft
    from the north wall of building YY for the storage of waste solvent and miscellaneous flammables. The
    building is protected with an automatic dry chemical system

    of flammables on the building FA dock while waiting QC testing and inspection. Flammable flux is used in

The site survey consisted of the following:
- A review of recent or planned changes in production, products, construction, or fire protection;
- A review of loss prevention Human Element Programs;
- A review of preventative and predictive maintenance procedures;
- A partial tour of the production facility interior and exterior, as limited by security requirements;
- A visual inspection of fire protection equipment and associated fire protection control valves, as limited
by security requirements;
- Discussion of observations and recommendations;
Human Element programs were found to be in various stages of development. Programs reviewed included
the following:
- Housekeeping;
- Hot Work;
- Fire Protection Impairments;
- Fire Protection Inspection and Maintenance;
- Management of Change;
- Smoking Policy;
- Contractors Work Procedures;
- Emergency Procedures;
- Business Contingency Planning;
Continuity of combustibles throughout the site is generally considered light to moderate in most areas.
Production hazards are considered to be low and are generally well controlled.
Security at this site is considered to be adequate with access control systems in place in all building.
Security service is provided on site during the day shift. All fire alarms ring to the security headquarters
at the Some Aerospace Facility in Broomfield, Colorado.
Key opportunities for improvement were observed with recommendations made as follows:
1. Improve or add sprinkler protection in critical areas;
2. Improve maintenance and inspection of fire protection equipment;
3. Improve inspection and service of fire extinguishers;
4. Provide battery backup for aspirating smoke detection systems in in critical assembly and testing areas;
5. Improving storage of flammable liquids on the FA dock;
6. Repair the leaking fire department connection for the FA building;
7. Provide CO2 fire protection for the Heller 1707 MK III wave soldering machine in the FA building;
8. Develop an effective business contingency plan for all critical operations;
9. The solid shelving in the store room area should to allow for fire sprinkler distribution;
